# Route planning

## Problem definition
Given a list of countries and time constraint, suggest a route to travel that meets time contraint. The solution route must start and end at the same country.

## Algorithms
- Breadth first search: guaranteed optimal solution, unrealistic runtime on problem domain containing more than 10 countries
- Best first greedy search: solution optimal, fast to generate solution even on largest domain possible (241 countries).
