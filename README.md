# Route planning

## Problem definition
Given a list of countries and time constraint, suggest a route to travel that meets time constraint. The solution route must start and end at the same country.

## Algorithms
- Breadth first search: guaranteed optimal solution, unrealistic runtime on problem domain containing more than 10 countries
- Best first greedy search: solution optimal, fast to generate solution even on largest domain possible (241 countries).

## How to run the program
- Install python3 and clone the repository to your local machine
- In terminal, navigate to the repository, type "python3 project.py" to run the script
- Follow the instructions provided by the script
